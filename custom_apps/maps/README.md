# Nextcloud Maps

**🌍🌏🌎 The whole world fits inside your cloud!**

- **🗺 Beautiful map:** Using [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) and [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com), you can choose between standard map, satellite, topographical, dark mode or even watercolor! 🎨
- **⭐ Favorites:** Save your favorite places, privately! Sync with [GNOME Maps](https://github.com/nextcloud/maps/issues/30) and mobile apps is planned.
- **🧭 Routing:** Possible using either [OSRM](http://project-osrm.org), [GraphHopper](https://www.graphhopper.com) or [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com).
- **🖼 Photos on the map:** No more boring slideshows, just show directly where you were!
- **🙋 Contacts on the map:** See where your friends live and plan your next visit.
- **📱 Devices:** Lost your phone? Check the map!
- **〰 Tracks:** Load GPS tracks or past trips. Recording with [PhoneTrack](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/net.eneiluj.nextcloud.phonetrack/) or [OwnTracks](https://owntracks.org) is planned.

Future plans:
- **📆 Events on the map:** Know where you need to go next!
- **🗺 Different projections:** The [Mercator projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercator_projection) is very biased, as you can see from [The True Size of Africa](http://kai.sub.blue/en/africa.html). Another view like the [Gall-Peters projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gall%E2%80%93Peters_projection) would be a possibility.

## User Documentation
### My Maps
Custom maps are stored by default in the "/Maps" folder. This folder can be found in the
files app. Other folders turned into map by placing a ".index.maps" file into it.
Content can therefore be added via:
 - Webdav (Desktop and Mobile clients)
 - Files app
 - Maps app

Custom maps can then be shared from the maps or any other app.

#### Sharing map
Maps can be shared using the nextcloud sharing system.

#### Favorites on custom map
Favorites on custom the custom maps are stored in the .favorites.json file.

Shared favorite categories can be linked to a custom map.
Linked favorite categories are read-only.
They can be edited on the owners default map.
These links are stored in the ".favorite_shares.json".

Scanning photos take time. Therefore photos are scanned in the background.
After adding photos it might take a while,
until the scan is done and the photos are shown on the map.
