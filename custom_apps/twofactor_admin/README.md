This two-factor auth (2FA) provider for Nextcloud allows admins to generate a one-time
code for users to log into a 2FA protected account. This is helpful in situations where
users have lost access to their other 2FA methods or mandatory 2FA without any previously
enabled 2FA provider.

For more details, see the [admin documentation] and [user documentation].
