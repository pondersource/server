    "An app for Nextcloud that automatically assigns tags to newly uploaded files based on some conditions.\n\nThe tags can later be used to control retention, file access, automatic script execution and more.\n\n## How it works\nTo define tags, administrators can create and manage a set of rule groups. Each rule group consists of one or more rules combined through operators. Rules can include criteria like file type, size, time and more. A request matches a group if all rules evaluate to true. On uploading a file all defined groups are evaluated and when matching, the given tags are assigned to the file." : "此Nextcloud应用能根据一些条件自动给新上传的文件打标签。\n\n这些标签后续可用于控制文件保留，文件访问，自动脚本执行及其他操作。\n\n## 它是怎么工作的\n要定义标签，管理员需要创建和管理一个规则组集合。每个规则组包含一个或多个由操作符组合起来的规则。规则可以包含如文件类型，大小，时间等的条件。如果规则组中所有规则的值都为真，则可说一个请求匹配了此规则组。当一个文件上传时，所有定义的规则组都会被评估，当匹配时，相应的标签将会分配给文件。",
